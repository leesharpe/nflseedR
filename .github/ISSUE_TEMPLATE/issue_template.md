Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, please don't use this form. Instead, ask in the **nflseedR channel** in the [nflfastR Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/5Er2FBnnQa).

Before opening a new issue, be sure to search [issues](https://github.com/nflverse/nflseedR/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/nflverse/nflseedR/pulls) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 

Please include a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample (AKA a reprex) using the [reprex package](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/). If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

Brief description of the problem
